C++ Examples
------------
The examples in this repo are supported by Visual Studio 2022 and  Visual Studio Code.  
It is a collection of independent CPP VS Projects under one solution - cpp-examples.sln 
which can be loaded into Visual Studio 2022. Before running a  specific project it is 
necessary to set that project to the default startup project (right click on the project 
in the Solution Explorer). 

The repo folder can also be opened in VS Code and each project run within the VS Code  
environment. I will be necessary to configure VS Code to work with a specific CPP compiler   
such as gcc, clang or MSVC:
